# ResNet
Implementation of a simple ResNet architecture for image classification of CIFAR 10 dataset as part of the Deep Learning course at ESPCI Paris.
A simple residual block of one convolution, followed by a ReLU transformation and then a batch normalization was used.
Trying to get a better performance, a ResNet9 architecture was also implemented.
